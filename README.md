# How to delete an item?

(This only works for Fixed and Random Rewards, Lockbox key modifications are not currently implemented....but maybe in the future)

Select the item you want to delete then click on Delete.

# Note

Please keep in mind that TERA uses 1 as 100%, so if you want a probability of 10% then you have to set the probability to 0.10 and so on.
